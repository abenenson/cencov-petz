# `CencovPetz.SimplexTopology`

Topology on the finite open simplex.

We use the topology induced by the coordinate map `p ↦ p.p : Simplex α → (α → ℝ)`.  Since the
proof fields of `Simplex` are propositions, this agrees with the usual subspace topology.

## Main results

- `CencovPetz.Simplex.continuous_p`
- `CencovPetz.Simplex.continuous_eval`
